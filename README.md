# GlowCart (React Native / Expo)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The assignment instructed me to build this project using **React Native CLI**.  
> Due to laptop performance issues, I built it with **Expo (Managed Workflow)**.  
> The code and structure are fully compatible with React Native CLI if migrated later.
